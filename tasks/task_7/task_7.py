Take inspiration from the style of the passage below (three sections, bolded headings, narrative tone)
but create a completely new piece that focuses on {category_name}. Do not reuse the original facts,
metrics, or conclusions. Instead, weave a different storyline that could plausibly come from a
market analysis but is not directly relevant to the original question. Maintain the formatting cues
(bolded section titles, short paragraphs) so the file blends into the haystack.

Original passage for reference:
{base_passage}

Return only the new passage text you generate.
