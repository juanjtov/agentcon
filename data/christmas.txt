Christmas is celebrated around the world in ways that reflect each region’s culture, history, and traditions. 
In many Western countries such as Canada, the United States, and much of Europe, Christmas is 
marked by decorated trees, festive lights, and gatherings with family and friends. 
Communities come together for markets, concerts, and charity events, 
and children eagerly await the arrival of Santa Claus. Foods like roasted turkey, gingerbread, and 
eggnog often appear on holiday tables.

In Latin America, Christmas celebrations are vibrant and community-driven, 
with traditions such as Las Posadas in Mexico, which reenacts Mary and Joseph’s search for shelter. 
Many families attend midnight mass on Christmas Eve, known as La Misa del Gallo. Festive foods like tamales, buñuelos, 
and sweet breads are central to the holiday, and fireworks light up the night skies in several countries. Music and 
dancing naturally blend into the celebrations, making Christmas both spiritual and joyous.

Across parts of Asia and Africa, Christmas is celebrated by Christian communities in unique and meaningful ways. 
In the Philippines, one of the world’s longest Christmas seasons features lantern festivals called parols and lively street parades. 
In Ethiopia, Christmas—known as Ganna—is celebrated on January 7 with church services, white traditional clothing, and community feasts. 
Meanwhile, in countries like Japan and South Korea, Christmas has evolved into a more secular celebration, often centered around 
illumination displays, gift-giving, and shared meals with loved ones. Even where it is not a national holiday, Christmas 
has become a moment of light, kindness, and togetherness across cultures.
