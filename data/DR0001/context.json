            "U.S. grocers are working to meet the FDA's FSMA 204 traceability rules by January 2026, which require tracking lot codes and key data for high-risk foods to expedite recalls. This compliance is viewed as an \"evolutionary step\" to modernize grocery operations and enhance food safety.",
            "By capturing detailed traceability data, such as lot codes, at every step, retailers can meet regulations and gain inventory benefits. This allows grocers to know exact expiration dates by lot, enabling them to discount items before they expire, thus reducing food waste and keeping products fresher.",
            "Regional grocers like Lunds & Byerlys and Raley\u2019s see FSMA 204 as a chance to enhance their systems and supply chain transparency. They believe improved traceability will boost customer trust and could signal the start of more extensive future food safety regulations."
