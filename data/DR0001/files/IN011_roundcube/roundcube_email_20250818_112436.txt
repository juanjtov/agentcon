Dear David and Samantha,

I hope this email finds you well. As we continue to prioritize food safety and customer trust, I wanted to share with you our latest FSMA 204 compliance update for Q2 2025. Our team has been working diligently to ensure that our high-risk food suppliers meet the necessary standards.

As of Q2 2025, I am pleased to report that 85% of our high-risk food suppliers are FSMA 204 compliant, totaling 270 vendors. This is a significant achievement, and I believe it demonstrates our commitment to maintaining the highest standards of food safety.

I have attached a detailed report to this email, which provides a breakdown of our compliance rates and identifies areas for further improvement. I would be happy to discuss this report in more detail with you both and answer any questions you may have.

Best regards,
Emily Patel
